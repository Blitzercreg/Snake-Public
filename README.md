Snake
Current Ver 1.1

As of now, the snake is created, can move automatically, be told which direction to move to and has a tail. Unfortunately
the code that provides the "tail" end does not run as smoothly as wanted. When the snake moves back over itself, the squares
turn gray on top of the snake so it looks choppy. Will find another way to do this possibly.
