As of now, the snake is created, can move automatically, be told which direction to move to, has a tail, gains a point from every blue 
square hit, extends tail and the score is displayed. 
Snake now cannot crawl back into itself as easily.

***Multiple squares on start

***Different color squares for different amount of points
